              <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Overall, target audience testing was a very helpful experience. Though I
                  was already aware of the main issues with my prototype, I most definitely
                  gained different insight and advice that I would not have thought of by myself. Audience testers were given 5 minutes to navigate their way through my page without me speaking to them, after which I was allowed to speak and explain my project. I asked both audience testers to point out any confusions or difficulties they had while navigating through the prototype, as well as their personal thoughts, opinions, and suggestions for my project.
                </p>

              <h3>What Did I Learn?</h3>
                <p>I learned that most audience members will not completely or thoroughly read through instructions - if they see text that indicates something, they will assume it is there on the page. For example, in my instructions section, my last instruction directs users to hover over the drop down menu located in the left hand corner. Though I thought it was quite clear that the instructions were for the music player page, the audience member informed me that his eyes immediately went to the top lefthand corner and that he expected the drop down menu to be there. I also realized that the last list item (the link to the audiovisualizer page) on my scroll down menu on the main page is not very obvious - audience members simply expected it to navigate to another #page within the main page. Another issue that I had not taken note of was that audience members might want to read the links listed under my sources in the research section. Obviously, it would simply be much more convenient to have these links be clickable rather than static list items as I had made them. One of the testers also commented that he wished the links to my sources under research were clickable so that he could immediately go to those sites and read more on my topic. The color selectors were also not functioning by the time we had the audience testers come. Both did comment that the site was fairly easy to navigate through, however.
                </p>

              <h3>What Will I Change?</h3>
              <p>I will create a separate visualizer button on the main page that is visible on all the other pages as well, so that users can immediately navigate to the music player page from any one of the pages. I will also change the body font type, as I noticed a small glitch with the kerning of certain characters. I will also make the links for my sources clickable so that users can directly go to those specific sites and read more on my topic. I will also remove the last step of my instructions (as it is misleading and also because drop down menus are self explanatory by nature). </p>
