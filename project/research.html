              <h3><strong>Designing for Diversity within the Classroom Environment</strong></h3>
                <p>I am interested in the topics of designing for diversity - more
                  specifically, the design of applications that address the needs
                  of students with mental illnesses/learning disabilities. For my
                  background research, I decided to delve more into specific learning
                  disabilities as well as existing strategies and key tips used to
                  aid students in the classroom environment. I also tried to find
                  any applications that are used by those with learning disabilities.
                  I have not yet decided whether I will focus mental illness or
                  learning disabilities but since learning disabilities is an area
                  that I am less familiar with, I looked more into AD/HD and dyslexia
                  and researched their characteristics and similarities.<br><br>


                  Dyslexia is a learning disability that involves general difficulty
                  in reading/interpreting words and letters but does not affect one’s
                  general intelligence in other areas. AD/HD, on the other hand, is a
                  learning disability that is most commonly characterized by inattention,
                  hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The two conditions tend to overlap and
                  though they are not caused by one another, oftentimes individuals may
                  have both. Genetics plays a role in both conditions. In terms of
                  similarities between the two, dyslexic individuals can have difficulties
                  paying attention to reading because it is so demanding, just as
                  individuals with AD/HD would struggle with maintaining concentration.
                  Both people with dyslexic and AD/HD conditions typically have trouble
                  with writing as well: AD/HD individuals struggle with proofreading and
                  and organization just as dyslexic individuals do. Especially in the
                  classroom environment, these conditions tend to deter otherwise
                  bright children - because of their struggles in keeping up with the
                  curriculum as well as their peers, they become unmotivated and lose
                  self-confidence.	Dyslexia is a learning disability that involves general
                  difficulty in reading/interpreting words and letters but does not affect
                  one’s general intelligence in other areas. AD/HD, on the other hand, is
                  a learning disability that is most commonly characterized by inattention,
                  hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The two conditions tend to overlap and
                  though they are not caused by one another, oftentimes individuals may
                  have both. Genetics plays a role in both conditions. In terms of
                  similarities between the two, dyslexic individuals can have difficulties
                  paying attention to reading because it is so demanding, just as
                  individuals with AD/HD would struggle with maintaining concentration.
                  Both people with dyslexic and AD/HD conditions typically have trouble
                  with writing as well: AD/HD individuals struggle with proofreading and
                  organization just as dyslexic individuals do. Especially in the classroom
                  environment, these conditions tend to deter otherwise bright children -
                  because of their struggles in keeping up with the curriculum as well as
                  their peers, they become unmotivated and lose self-confidence.<br><br>

                  According to many studies, however, both dyslexic and AD/HD students are
                  usually able to successfully adapt to their conditions. In fact, about 40-50%
                  of children after puberty with AD/HD or Dyslexia are able to develop coping
                  mechanisms well enough to be successful (attend grad school, secure a career).
                  The other 50-60%, however, may be negatively affected by their conditions for
                  the remainder of the life.<br><br>

                  After educating myself more closely on these conditions, I then looked into
                  classroom strategies recommended by teachers as to how these students’ unique
                  learning capabilities might be addressed. I found that, in the teacher/professor’s
                  perspective, it is most important to realize that learning disabilities are
                  not an intelligence indicator nor a result of a behavior issue - they
                  should/need to be correctly identified and treated as such. The progress of
                  students with learning disabilities should be examined at each of the 4 stages
                  of learning, which include input, integration, storage and output.<br><br>

                  Next, I then examined existing interfaces that aid students with learning disabilities.
                  These apps, to list a few, include ‘ModMath’, ‘MyTalkTools Mobile’, ‘Dyslexia Toolbox’,
                  ‘Voice Dream Reader’, and ‘Stop, Breath & Think’. ‘ModMath’ is a free app that is targeted
                  more towards students with dyslexia and dysgraphia. It is a tool that helps students solve
                  math problems without having to physically write out a problem/solve it on paper. ‘MyTalkTools
                  Mobile’ is a more innovative application that allows students to express themselves and
                  communicate using anything from a combination of words, sounds, and images. ‘Dyslexia Toolbox’
                  is an app that was created by dyslexic people for dyslexic people, featuring a variety of useful
                  tools such as word prediction, text readers, digital overlays, and type pads. The ‘Voice Dream
                  Reader’ is an application designed for students of all ages with AD/HD or reading disabilities.
                  It allows users to highlight text then have that text read back to them. And lastly, ‘Stop,
                  Breath & Think’ is a meditative app that helps students destress and relax by prompting them
                  to think about how they feel.<br><br>

                  In addition to these applications, I found out more about features online that serve to help people
                  with learning disabilities navigate a web page, like a screen readers, language translators, audio
                  recording tools, page simplifiers, text magnifiers, and screen masking tools. I began to consider how,
                  through javascript librairies and plug-ins with audio input, these features might be implemented.<br><br>
