              <h3>Miracle Modus</h3>
                <p>Miracle Modus by Seebs, LLC is an interactive app that displays
                  beautiful, soothing patterns of light and sound. Though the app
                  was initially intended for individuals with anxiety or autism,
                  it has gained popularity with people that simply wish to destress
                  and relax. One important thing to note, however, is that this app,
                  by no means, is a cure for Autism. Autistic people commonly experience
                  sensory overload and therefore, the simple and patterned visual
                  imagery the app displays is meant to simply reduce sensory intensity.
                  Many users have reportedly felt feelings of distress when viewing
                  images where the patterning was unclear, but this distress fades
                  as they come to understand the pattern.<br><br>


                  The basic interface displays brightly-colored patterns and objects
                  that responds to user activity (touching, dragging, gravity, etc.).
                  Users can alter gears and navigate between different modes which
                  give users options between different sounds, palettes, and lines.
                  Different sound effects include ‘Metal Bell’ and ‘Airy Bell,’ while
                  different palette choices include ‘Earth,’ ‘Ocean,’ and ‘Pastel.’
                  As for lines, there are 6 options that describe thickness and speed:
                  ‘Thin,’ ‘Medium,’ ‘Thick,’ and ‘Fast,’ ‘Medium,’ and ‘Smooth,’ The
                  last type of settings the app offers is scene settings which include
                  options such as ‘Spiraling Shape (the arms drift towards the areas on
                  the screen that have been touched by the user)’, ‘Painting Hexes (hexes
                  drift across the screen, spreading and smearing different colors),’ and
                  ‘Knights (squares move across the screen as they change color).’ These
                  are just 3 of the 15 total different scene settings on the app. Each
                  different scene setting is matched with a unique sound interaction.
                  For each of these settings, there is an ‘enable’ and ‘disable’
                  function as well. The app is available for iOS 4.3 and is compatible
                  with the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, as well as Android 2.2 and up.<br><br>


                  The concept for the interface is strong. I believe visual imagery
                  and ‘art’ can be used to help those with any sort of disability as
                  well as mental health issue. In terms of interaction design, I think
                  that the different types of user interactions are well thought out
                  and that the selections of setting users are given allows for
                  individual/creative and artistic freedom. The interface is lacking
                  in terms of aesthetics, however. I believe the entire graphic
                  identity of the app could be improved upon and made cleaner and
                  more reflective of the purpose of the app I also believe the
                  visuals on the interface could be improved to be more smooth in
                  terms of movements and that more sound options could be added
                  (sounds that may better produce relaxation). For example, certain
                  types of music could be added to the app. The color schemes could
                  also be improved upon and also, in my opinion, present another
                  opportunity for user interaction (users could pick out colors
                  for a unique palette which they could then save and use themselves).
                  While reading reviews, I also discovered that some users experienced
                  glitches or bugs and that, in rare cases, the visuals would be stuck
                  on one scene setting - which led me to the conclusion that this
                  web interface could be further developed and refined in terms of
                  functionality and code/organization. I began to imagine the possibilities
                  of this concept as a large-scale projection through which many people
                  can interact with through movement sensors and microphones.<br><br>

              <h3>Swifty</h3>
                <p class = "text">Swifty is an app that was created by Apple. Essentially the app
                  teaches people to code in a rather simple and concise language
                  created by Apple, called Swift. The language was engineered by
                  Apple’s compiler experts, making it safe to assume that it is
                  compatible with existing languages/code as well as being relatively
                  fast. The app offers lessons and its release was accompanied by
                  the publishing of a free book that contains instructions as to
                  how to use the language.<br><br>


                  These tutorials/lessons are interactive: they guide users through
                  different types of information, including the very basics of different
                  data types as well as variables and functions, and users are encouraged
                  to type out lines of code. Visually, the interface has been designed
                  to look just like a coding environment though it functions more like
                  an online quiz. Each tutorial begins with a brief lesson where a
                  certain concept is explored and the previous lesson is reviewed.
                  The tutorial then displays a block of code where some crucial piece
                  of the code is missing and the user is expected to type out the correct
                  value, name, etc. The code then ‘runs.’ The first 13 tutorials of the
                  app are free, after which users must pay $2.99 to continue on with the
                  lessons. The app is available only for iOS devices.<br><br>


                  I believe that the concept of the app is compelling but that the
                  visual aspect of the interface could be modified to make the app/the
                  concept of coding less intimidating to novices. I also there are
                  more opportunities for interaction not only with the interface but
                  between users - incentives and rewards could be used to encourage
                  users to advance through the lessons and perhaps users could even
                  interact with one another. The app does well for providing a way
                  to learn on the go and the overall graphic design of the interface
                  is clean and well-organized. I believe that the app could have the
                  potential to spur more ideas for different web interfaces that might
                  also increase diversity in the engineering field and encourage more
                  females to pursue coding in the future.<br><br>
