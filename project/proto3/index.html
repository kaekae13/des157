        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p id='intro'>Certain colors are associated with certain moods and have the power to affect the emotional and mental state of people. Music is also a common source of relaxation for people that feel a need to destress and relieve themselves of anxiety or negative emotions. These findings bring forth the question of how music and color can work together to create a soothing yet effective and powerful way for people to connect with their emotions in a way that brings forth visual creativity.</p>

        <h3>Colors, Emotions, and Music</h3>
        <p>Color has come to hold cultural and evolutionary meanings. The emotions and ideas that we commonly associate with certain colors constantly affect our behavior and emotions, depending primarily upon the the saturation and brightness of a color (saturation refers to the pureness of a color while brightness refers to how light or dark a color is). Colors that are less saturated but bright have been proven to create feelings of relaxation while those that are more saturated while less bright are energizing and dynamic. Color also physiologically impacts the brain, directly influencing anxiety, pulse, blood flow, and arousal - even affecting our ability to recall words or memories.
        Studies have established associations between specific colors and emotions, as well as common cultural meanings that have, over time, been attached to certain colors, for example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>PINK</strong> - can be calming depending on context</li>
            <li><strong>RED</strong> - strength, boldness, arousing, stimulates excitement, passion, aggression, intense</li>
            <li><strong>ORANGE</strong> - arousing, enthusiasm, fun, energy, warmth</li>
            <li><strong>YELLOW</strong> - joy, excitement, energizing, optimism, youth, intellect, comfort, liveliness, conflict</li>
            <li><strong>GREEN</strong> - creativity, productivity, positivity, calming, healing, success, hope</li>
            <li><strong>BLUE</strong> - trustworthiness, relaxation, calming, stability, loyalty, stability, tranquility
            <li><strong>VIOLET</strong> - sophistication, royalty, luxury, spirituality</li>
            <li><strong>BLACK</strong> - aggressive, power, mystery, professional</li>
            <li><strong>GREY</strong> - neutral, practical, quiet</li>
            <li><strong>WHITE</strong> - purity, cleanliness, innocence</li>
        </ul>

          <h4> How does this relate to music?</h4>
          <p>Music has an intense effect on our brain - it triggers the pleasure centers of our brain to  release dopamine (a neurotransmitter that brings about emotions of happiness). Other studies have also proven that listening to music has proven to improve physical health, helping the body to produce increasing amounts of immunity-boosting antibodies and cells that protect against harmful bacteria and viruses. Music is also commonly used in a variety of different treatment scenarios for mental illness and other health conditions. The mood boosting and therapeutic effects of music have long been a controversial topic for researchers but findings support that even sad music/minor toned music induce feelings of pleasure and comfort for listeners. The majority of participants also reported feeling emotions of positivity. Thus, mixing color and music can have therapeutic effects on the mind, especially depending on the personal preferences of an individual and the state of mind or mood they are in. The mood visualizer is an interactive way for anyone to play with color, sound, and simple visuals and provide a source of entertainment, distraction or relaxation. This interface is meant to cultivate creative and artistic thinking and stimulate users' inner creativity, as well as a greater awareness of their emotions.</p>
