    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p class= "content">Certain colors are associated with certain moods and have the power to affect the emotional and mental state of people. Music is also a common source of relaxation for people that feel a need to destress and relieve themselves of anxiety or negative emotions. These findings bring forth the question of how music and color can work together to create a soothing yet effective and powerful way for people to connect with their emotions in a way that brings forth visual creativity.</p>
