              <section id="personaMain">
                <h4>Job</h4>
                  <p>Emily works as a counselor at the Kids' Club at Fairmont Hotels.
                    She supervises kids at day camps and leads various activities
                    including circle time, story time, volcano making, arts and crafts, etc.</p>

                <h4>Goals and Challenges</h4>
                  <p>Her goals are primarily to distract herself from any kind of distress
                    as well as anxiety or even depression, as well as to find others
                    experiencing similar issues. For example, Tumblr is a frequent site for her
                    because it is a popular platform for others who were also experiencing
                    depression or anxiety, and made her feel more understood and less alone
                    in her emotional struggles. She also goes to music apps (Spotify,
                    Soundcloud), as well as watching/listening to ASMR videos on Youtube
                    for the same purposes.</p><br><br>

                  <p>Her challenges with achieving her goals with the existing applications
                    and web interfaces she uses is that they oftentimes do little to actually
                    relieve her stress/anxiety because she chooses to listen to certain music
                    or look at certain posts that instead reemphasize and worsen her emotional
                    state</p><br><br>

                  <p>In Emily's case, an application that focused solely on changing or reducing
                    these emotions would be much more successful. Though the majority of my background
                    research focuses on students with learning disabilities rather than just
                    mental health issues, I feel that students with learning disabilities would also
                    benefit from such an app. An immense pressure to keep up with the curriculum in
                    addition to their significantly different learning processes can create feelings
                    of stress and anxiety in the classroom environment - a phenomenon that is quite
                    common with dyslexic and dysgraphic students, as well as those with AD/HD.</p>

                <h4>Values and Fears</h4>
                  <p>Emily values self expression, which is why she frequents social media apps
                    where individuals can express who they are and interact with others. Going
                    along that line, Emily also enjoys other applications where people can express
                    their musical creativity (Soundcloud) as well as online content communities such
                    as Youtube where users can view, share, and create their own content.In terms of fears,
                    Emily does not enjoy apps that are too fixed or limited in their content.</p>
