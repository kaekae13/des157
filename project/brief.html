        <h1>Project Brief</h1><hr>

              <h3>Topic Summary</h3>
                <p>The topic that encompasses my project is issues of mental health and how music can provide an auditory as well as visual escape. My project is a customizable, and thus interactive audio visualizer. My project focuses on promoting wellbeing through an aesthetic sensibility and by calling on audience members/users to create their own visual definitions of music.</p>

              <h3>Target Audience Description</h3>
                <p>I am targeting audiences that are victims of stress, anxiety, or depression (more specifically, those aged 18-22 that are currently in school and thus subject to pressures about school, life, and their futures). In terms of income, I am speaking mostly to middle-income - those that can afford to own the technology necessary to use the application (iPhones, iPads, lapsops, etc.)</p>


              <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <p>The goals of the project are to help those experiencing overwhelming emotions of stress/anxiety/depression to distract themselves and relax while fulfilling their own creative desires in a fun and simple way. Users will be able to upload their own music files (mp3) and customize the color and type of audio visualizer (bars, waveforms, radial waveforms) that is being used. Users will also be able to select different background graphics to display while the music is playing, according to their mood or emotions.</p>

              <h3>Goals for Overall Look and Feel</h3>
                <p>The overall look of the application will be simple, modern, and clean. The typefaces used will be wider, rounded, and sans-serif in order to cater to a younger audience (e.g. Quicksand or Muli). As for the graphics, they will be clean with thick lines and minimal color schemes in order to leave the page looking uncluttered and sleek. There will be 14-15 color choices for the audio visualizer, all of which will be bright colors (bright colors have psychologically been proven to help uplift emotions and positively influence mental wellbeing). The audio visualizer will be also be clean and simple, centered in the page. All audio control buttons (play, pause, volume buttons, color choice menu, graphics menu) will be located right below the audio visualizer in one row and centered, making the page easy to navigate. This will also help create a clear separation between the menu and the audio visualizer itself.</p>
